Installer hangs during install (and I have iPhone developer tools installed)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The iPhone developer tools require some kind of gnarly system lock
that causes the MacOS X installer system to hang. Just quit the iPhone
SDK and try again.

"git-svn is missing"
--------------------
Mac OS X no longer ships with SVN, and this installer no longer ships
with git-svn support.

Complain about that here:

Handling of international characters in file is broken
------------------------------------------------------

If you would like some validation, read this: http://is.gd/5NAN9.
You're not alone.

This is not an issue with Git, not the installer. Apparently
subversion has it too.
